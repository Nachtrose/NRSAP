# Nachtrose's Sci-Fi ( and modern ) Animated Pack / NRSAP for short

## Hottest news

After a talk with the great Sequencer guy, Adam Oresten, i was offered the possibility to host his Hyperspeed assets in my module, main reason being, that it will cut on the size of his code oriented module. And it greatly fits here.

### **A big "Thank you Adam!"**

## About

This module has been inspired into existence by Jules & Ben's Animated attacks ( [ JB2A ](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e) ) which it means to compliment in fields, that aren't J&B's focus, sci-fi and modern assets.
By a fickle twists of fate i managed in the end finish my take on FTL style travel earlier than any of the attack animations i was aiming for and as people seemed to be interested in these assets, i decided to start this module with just that. To make the setup a little easier, i have ~~stolen~~ borrowed the Hyperspace macro from Adam Oresten's [Sequencer](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer) module.
I also want to thank **wildj79** and **Deepflame** and all the other contributors for their great work on the Starfinder system module which is the number one reason i am making this module at all.

## Dependencies

This module is system and language agnostic and the assets included have no dependencies themself.
However, if you do not wan't everything to set up manually, this module will bundle some example macros, that might require other modules to work properly. This list might grow in the future.
